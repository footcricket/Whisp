# ChatWave: Real-Time Java Chat with GUI

ChatWave is a simple and intuitive chat application developed in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to engage in real-time communication using socket programming. The server defines the IP and port, while the client specifies these details to connect to the desired server. Users can set custom usernames and exchange messages seamlessly.

This project was created as part of the Fundamentals of Networks subject in the BSc in Computer Engineering program at the University of Granada.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).
- Real-time chat functionality using sockets.
- Customizable usernames for each client.
- Server configuration for defining the IP and port.
- Real-time message exchange between connected clients.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of networking concepts.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/footcricket05/ChatWave-Real-Time-Java-Chat-with-GUI.git
   ```

2. Open the server and client Java files in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

3. Compile and run the server file to start the server application. The server should specify the IP address and port for clients to connect.

4. Compile and run the client file to start the client application. Connect to the server by providing the server's IP address and port.

5. You can now engage in real-time chat with other connected clients using the GUI.
